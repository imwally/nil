Well it's taken me long enough but I finally setup
[pelican](https://blog.getpelican.com) on my MacBook. The number of
blogs I've attempted to create over the years is probably in the teens
by now. None of which have been particularly successful, and by that I
mean updated regularly. That might have something to do with the fact
I'm not very good at writing which might have something to do with the
fact that I don't write very much. Here's another attempt at breaking
that cycle.

It took me a good 15 minutes just to write that first paragraph...

Anyway, this post is mostly a starting point for getting a better feel
of how pelican works and how I want this blog to look. The other bits
I don't have fleshed out yet are where to host this, how to store it,
and what topics to cover. I guess I'm somewhat of a perfectionist in
my mind so dwelling on those things until they're *right* will only
get me to where I currently am, nowhere.

What do I want (or what do I hope to get out writing more)?

* Become a better writer.
* Become a better programmer.
* Become less self defeating.
* Be honest with myself.

I have a bad habit of saying I have a bad habit of something. One of
those bad habits being that I'm not very confident in myself. Not
entirely sure if this is considered [imposter
syndrome](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Impostor_syndrome) or if I
really think I know nothing. 

One thing I am sure of however is that this way of thinking has
stunted my intellectual growth and harmed my career. Deliberately
avoiding technical discussion with my peers and my best friends or not
contributing in public dialog (twitter, forums, etc...) with my
thoughts and opinions because I'm afraid of what other might say has
not gotten me very far. This might partly come from when I got my
first computer and started messing around with Linux many years
ago. It was generally frowned upon in the community to ask questions
without first reading the fucking manual.

There is this voice in the back of my head that says if you don't know
EVERYTHING about a certain subject then you have no authority to write
about it or participate in public dialog about it. Silly, huh?

Somehow I've written more than I anticipated. Think it's time to wrap
this one up.

My best friend encouraged me to setup a new blog and to just write so
that's what I'm doing. Here's to more learning, more participation and
renewed interest in computing.
